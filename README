This project contains small demo OpenCL programs.

The intention is to provide simple C programs that
can drive KLEE-CL (compile with whole-llvm).

After cloning this repository run the following

$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

so that the necessary submodules are cloned and
set to the right commit.
